# Explore Data Science Process
This is a rather open ended exercise with the aim to get some practice working through the steps of the Data Science Process

## Group Goal
Analyzing vaccination rates, trends, and their relationship with disease occurrence and country-specific predictors across Europe.

## Questions
How do vaccination rates against various diseases vary across Europe? How has this rate changed over time? Is the occurrence of certain diseases higher in areas in which vaccination is lower? Are there country characteristics that predict vaccination levels, or trends in vaccination levels?
