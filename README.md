## Group Goal
Analyzing vaccination rates, trends, and their relationship with disease occurrence and country-specific predictors across countries.

## Questions
How do vaccination rates against various diseases vary across countries? How has this rate changed over time? Is the occurrence of certain diseases higher in areas in which vaccination is lower? Are there country characteristics that predict vaccination levels, or trends in vaccination levels?

## Dataset 
- Vaccination coverage  
  https://immunizationdata.who.int/global?topic=Vaccination-coverage&location=
- Reported cases and Incidence  
  https://immunizationdata.who.int/global?topic=Reported-cases-and-incidence&location=
- Human Development Index
